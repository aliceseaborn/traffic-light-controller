# Traffic Light Controller

Using system verilog, we developed a controller unit for a simple two street intersection complete with corresponding lights and traffic sensors. Given that the configuration of the lights is finite, a state-machine approach was applied to describe the intersection's behavior. The lights will remain in their current state until the sensors on the opposing street trigger a change in traffic flow. In such a case, a transient state occurs which slows the current traffic prior to introducing opposing traffic.

This project was completed as a requirement for ECE 482, High Level Synthesis and Codesign, to earn an undergraduate degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering.
